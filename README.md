**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
--------------------------------
User stories really help break down what people actually want into something a developer can use. nstead of just hearing “I want a travel app,” you figure out what that means in smaller, more detailed pieces. Using the format “As a [user], I want to [do something] so that [I get this benefit]” helped me translate vague goals into real features that could be designed, coded, and tested. It helped the team stay focused on the importance of each innovation and creativity rather than just its technical aspects.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
--------------------------------
User stories really help break down what people actually want into something a developer can use. Instead of just hearing “I want a travel app,” you figure out what that means in smaller, more detailed pieces. Using the format “As a [user], I want to [do something] so that [I get this benefit]” helped me translate vague goals into real features that could be designed, coded, and tested. It helped the team stay focused on the importance of each innovation and creativity rather than just its technical aspects.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
--------------------------------
When I’m working on a project, I’ve found that starting small and building little by little works best. I like the rhythm of sprints-planning what can realistically get done, checking in during stand-ups, and then reviewing and reflecting at the end. It keeps the team organized and gives us space to adjust when things change (because they always do). I definitely want to keep using things like retrospectives, sprint planning, and user stories in future projects. They make the whole process feel more manageable and collaborative instead of just tackling one huge task all at once.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
--------------------------------
Knowing how to code isn't the only thing you need to be a part of a development team. You need to know how to collaborate and communicate effectively to support the team’s goals. There’s always going to be different perspectives and skill levels, and that’s actually a good thing. In our previous group discussions, I learned how valuable it is to give everyone a chance to speak and bring ideas to the table. Even when we didn’t all agree, we found ways to meet in the middle and move forward. I think trust and respect go a long way in team environments. When people feel heard, they’re more likely to stay motivated and do their best work.

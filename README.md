How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
--------------------------------
To me, building something useful starts with actually listening to what people need. I try to look at the bigger picture of what someone is trying to do, and then break that down into smaller features. You’re not just building something to look nice or run fast; it needs to actually solve a real problem for someone. That’s where user stories come in. The structure of “As a [user], I want to [do something] so that [I can accomplish a goal]” helps narrow things down and puts the focus on the user's perspective.

I can utilize that structure to draw the connection between what the user is attempting to achieve and how I might implement that in the application, rather than guessing about what a feature should do.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
--------------------------------
When I’m working on a project, I’ve found that starting small and building little by little works best. I like the rhythm of sprints-planning what can realistically get done, checking in during stand-ups, and then reviewing and reflecting at the end. It keeps the team organized and gives us space to adjust when things change (because they always do). I definitely want to keep using things like retrospectives, sprint planning, and user stories in future projects. They make the whole process feel more manageable and collaborative instead of just tackling one huge task all at once.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
--------------------------------
Knowing how to code isn't the only thing you need to be a part of a development team. You need to know how to collaborate and communicate effectively to support the team’s goals. There’s always going to be different perspectives and skill levels, and that’s actually a good thing. In our previous group discussions, I learned how valuable it is to give everyone a chance to speak and bring ideas to the table. Even when we didn’t all agree, we found ways to meet in the middle and move forward. I think trust and respect go a long way in team environments. When people feel heard, they’re more likely to stay motivated and do their best work.
